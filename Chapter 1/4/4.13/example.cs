// Write code fragments to create a two-dimentional array b[][] that is a copy 
// of the existing two-dimentional array a[][], under each of the following assumptions:
// a. a[][] is a square
// b. a[][] is a rectangle
// c. a[][] may be ragged

// Your solution to b should work for a, and your solution to c should work for
//  both b and a, and our code should get progressively more complicated.
