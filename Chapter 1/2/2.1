The Sequence Shifts Variable assignments around in the following manner:
int a, b; - inline declare two variables
a = 10 - assign an integer (10) value to variable a
b = 20 - assign an integer (20) value to variable b

int t = a (t = 10) - declared variable t takes the value of varible a

a = b (a = 20) - variable a takes the value of variable b
b = t (b = 10) - variable b takes the value of variable t
