# CompSci

This Repository is a Work Book with the Examples from the book:
"Computer Science: An Interdisicplinary Approach" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

The book guides the reader on Java programming, however *these* Exersizes have been converted into C# solutions for the purpose
of understanding the C# Language.

Instead of using the javac compiler, please use the csc.exe compiler provided by .Net
